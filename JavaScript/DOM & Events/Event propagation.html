Event propagation 
- bubbling and capturing

Event propagation allows for the definition of the element order when an event occurs

- Bubbling - the innermost element's event is handled first and then the outer element's event is handled

- Capturing - the outermost element's event is handled first and then the inner element's event is handled

Capturing goes down the DOM
Bubbling goes up the DOM

The addEventListener() method allows you to specify the propagation type with the useCapture parameter

The default value is false, which means the bubbling propagation is used
When the value is true, the capturing propagation is used


-->

<script type="text/javascript">
	// Capturing propagation
	ele1.addEventListener("click", myFunc, true);

	// Bubbling propagation
	ele2.addEventListener("click", myFunc, false);

	// Useful when you have the same event handled for multiple elements in the DOM hierarchy

</script>
